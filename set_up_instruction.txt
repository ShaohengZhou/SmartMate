********************************************************
Here, we are gonna make our own backend by IAM profile *
To do this we need a IAM profile in our AWS account.   *
By now we should each have a IAM profile, so we don't  *
need to worry about that. If you don't have one, you   *
should run:                                            *
	amplify configure			       *
But this needs AWS account, come to Shawn to help you. *
						       *
**notice** DO NOT hare your access key ID or secret    *
           access key                                  *
********************************************************
Now we are creating your own backend
